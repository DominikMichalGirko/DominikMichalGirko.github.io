                   <p class="kot">Phasmohobia game you can play on pc and also connect it to VR. <br>Game was release  at 18 September 2020<br> <strong><em>  Phasmophobia </em></strong> is an investigative horror game developed and published by British  game studio Kinetic Games.<br>The  game is created by 25-year-old UK indie developer 'Dknighter', and "CJ" but we dont really know their name's.  <br>
               From when the game was crated back in 2020, to todays day game changed alot. Back in 2020 we got only 6maps (now its 16) we also got some new items(as DOTS projector, we can use it to look if ghost passed by),and new ghosts <br>
                    Also when some big events are coming as like "Chrismas, Hallowen,Easter" developers always updating some events, so in this year's Chrismas we'll be getting some update.<br>
                 Usually people playing this game are 15+, sometimes when I play online i meet people 30+, so it can be diffrent ages.</p>

                    <p class="kot papa">  <strong><em>  Phasmophobia </em></strong> is a horror investigation survival game played from a first-person perspective. The player works solo or in a group with up to three other players to complete a contract in which they must identify the type of ghost haunting the specified site. Players can communicate through voice chat, both locally within a short distance and globally via walkie-talkies. <strong><em>  Phasmophobia </em></strong> features speech recognition allowing certain pieces of equipment and even the ghost to hear players speaking and understand key words and phrases. Completing objectives and gathering evidence provide a payout; complete as much as possible to level up, unlock maps and difficulties and earn money. </p>
